# population-control-npc
### A project on controlling the population of NPCs in video games

#### Important repo content
- Assignments: milestone assignments for this project
- Images: reinforcement learning/imitation learning results (tensorboard)
- demos: recordings used in imitaion learning
- results: neural networks
- Assets: all elements of the game
- Assets/Scripts: code

#### Installation guide
- Install Unity v2020.3.32 from https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
- Follow the ML Agents installation guide from https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

#### To reproduce the results
- Open project in Unity 3D
##### For intial set-up
- Open the Anthill3.0 - Vanilla scene
- Run game and use the arrows to move the player

##### For machine learning set-up
- Open the Anthill2.0 - ML scene
- Make sure the Ant_ML2 object in the scene has the Behavior parameter model set to GetFoodMany neural network (from Assets/Brains)
- Run game

##### For prey-predator set-up
- Open the Anthill4.0 - Predator scene
- Run game and use arrows to move the player
